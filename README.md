### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sidhant Puntambekar. I am currently a master's student in biomedical informatics (AI + bioinformatics) at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. I also work as a bioinformatician at Boston Children's Hospital. During Spring 2023, I completed my undergraduate Computer Science degree with minors in Computational Biology and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder. My personal research and professional interests lie at the intersection of utilizing computational methods to streamline biological data analysis. 

Prior to Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's, I worked for 1.5 years as a bioinformatics analyst at Bionano Genomics in San Diego, CA where I developed pipelines, algorithms, and validations for the detection of copy number variations and structural variants in cytogenetics data from optical genome mapping (OGM) and next generation sequencing (NGS) methods as part of an agile development team. During summer 2022, I interned at Exact Sciences in Boston, MA helping to streamline and develop their multiple cancer early detection (MCED) program as a computational biology and data science intern. Further in the past, I worked as a research intern at Harvard Medical School in the computational genomics lab of Dr. Shamil Sunyaev. I originally started my career as a bioinformatics undergraduate researcher at the RNA Bioscience Initiative Informatics Fellows Group under Dr. Jay Hesselberth at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical School. 

Other programming interests of mine include object oriented programming, robotics, and full stack development. Back in college, I was also a part of the HackCU (University of Colorado Boulder Hackathon) Software and Technology Team, serving as its director.
